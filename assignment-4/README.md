### Requirements

Add layout for Assignment 3 web page as per the mock image and convert all CSS to SCSS syntax.

  1. The goal of this assignment is to learn about CSS positioning, Grid layout / Flexbox, SCSS features like variables, mixins, inheritance, loops, functions, math operations, etc.
  2. SCSS should be organized in multiple files based on UI features, common elements, and themes.
  3. These SCSS files should be added to a main.scss file and this should be converted to a .css file using sass.
  4. The navbar should be sticky/fixed.
  5. JavaScript is not required. This will not add more points to this assignment.
  6. Your site should look very close to the attached file.
  7. You should not use the table element for formatting.
  8. You should add code documentation using SCSS comments.
  9. If any asset required for the page is missing then use the below links for placeholder assets.
  10. Can use icons from material design <https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline> even if it doesn't match the UI mock.

### Github Link

<https://classroom.github.com/a/3MIQNioW> (Links to an external site.)

  1. Follow the GitHub link.
  2. Select your email address (the list is scrollable). If your email is not available, skip to the next step and let TAs know about it.
  3. Your git repo should have a .gitignore file excluding log files and README.md with the description of the assignment.
  4. You should have multiple smaller commits.
  5. You should push the assignment to the main/master branch of the assignment repo. Do not submit it on the Canvas.
  6. Your assignment will be assessed only based on HTML and SCSS.

### Grading

  1. Code documentation. (10 Points)
  2. .gitignore, README.md, and multiple Git commits (10 Points)
  3. If node_modules & dist directory not added in .gitignore file. (-5 Points)
  4. Use multiple SCSS files to organize your code. (5 Points)
  5. **If style attribute is used -25 points.**
  6. **If any libraries like bootstrap used -25 Points.**
  7. **Failing to use SCSS syntax including variables, nested selectors, mixins, inheritance, and loops  -25 Points.**
  8. **Additional points for using more SCSS constructs.**
  9. Assignment completion. (75 Points)
